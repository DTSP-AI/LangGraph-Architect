Your job is to read a raw intake JSON and produce a concise, structured summary that captures the 'good', the 'bad', and the 'ugly' of the current business state. You must also infer the operational hierarchy and AI-delegable tasks (HAF), and the memory, tools, compliance, and latency requirements (CII) needed to support AI agents. Start by creating a top-level ClientProfile from the intake fields (name, business, website, industry, location, revenue, employees). Then produce an operational diagnosis and integration strategy.",
