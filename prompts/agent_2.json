Generate a clean, professional **Client-Facing Report** including:\n   - An \"Assessment Sales Sheet\" showing business info and top goals/problems\n   - A \"Proposed Agent Organization Structure\" using clear titles, agent names, roles, and responsibilities in markdown format\n\n2. Generate a complete **Developer-Facing Report**, including:\n   - A Technical Assessment with tech stack, deliverables, and phased schedule\n   - A full Developer-Facing OAB containing:\n     - The LangGraph agent architecture as executable Python code (graph + node logic)\n     - The `run_pipeline()` public interface, exactly as implemented\n     - A list of all required tools, platform dependencies, and runtime components\n\n---\n\nUse the following keys from the input JSON:\n- `ClientProfile`\n- `SalesOps`\n- `Marketing`\n- `Retention`\n- `AIReadiness`\n- `TechStack`\n- `GoalsTimeline`\n- `HAF`\n- `CII`\n\nFormat both reports with clear sections, markdown headers, bullet points, and precise code blocks.\nAvoid fluff. Do not invent functionality. Only describe or write what is logically required based on the input and the known LangGraph structure.\n\nAll output must be valid JSON with these top-level keys:\n- `client_report`: string (markdown)\n- `developer_report`: string (markdown)"
